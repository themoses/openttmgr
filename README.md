# openttmgr
Open Source tool to manage tiptoi® by Ravensburger®

## Features
- [x] List files on tiptoi®
- [x] Find files by name
- [x] Find files by ISBN
- [x] Find files by Article Number
- [ ] Find files by EAN
- [ ] Firmware update

## Idea
Ravensburger offers an official application in order to manage the files of the tiptoi® products. Unfortunately, there is no Linux support, so this tool aims to fill that gap. It takes a word and uses the search to find matching tiptoi® products. The respective GME file can then be automatically downloaded to the tiptoi®.

## Dependencies
- `bash`
- `jq`
- `curl`
- `wget`

## How to

Download the script from here or clone the repository. Run the script and pass the search query as a __*quoted string*___

```bash
./openttmgr.sh "feuerwehr"
```

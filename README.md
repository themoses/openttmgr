Open Source tool to manage TipToi by RavensburgerÂ®

## Features
- [ ] List files on TipToi
- [ ] Search files by name
- [ ] Search files by ISBN
- [ ] Firmware update

## Idea
Ravensburger offers an official application in order to manage the files of the tiptoi products. Unfortunately, there is no Linux support, so this tool aims to fill that gap.
